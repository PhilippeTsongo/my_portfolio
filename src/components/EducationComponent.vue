                    During my master's study, I gained advanced knowledge and hands-on experience 
                    in various areas of internet systems, including web development, network architecture, 
                    cloud computing, and cybersecurity. I worked on multiple projects focusing on scalable 
                    internet solutions, implementing the latest technologies and protocols. My coursework covered 
                    topics such as distributed systems, data management, network security, and emerging internet 
                    technologies, which helped me build a strong foundation in designing, deploying, and managing 
                    complex internet-based systems.

                    During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, I developed a solid foundation in programming, 
                    algorithms, data structures, and software development. I gained proficiency in various programming 
                    languages, including Python, Java, Php, Javascript, C++, C and worked on projects that spanned web development and 
                    database management. My coursework also covered computer architecture, operating systems, artificial
                    intelligence, network administration and software engineering, allowing me to build essential 
                    problem-solving skills and a strong understanding of core computer science principles. This experience 
                    laid the groundwork for my journey as a full-stack developer.
